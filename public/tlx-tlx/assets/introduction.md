# Evaluating the task load of the task load index

This is a small study to evaluate the impact of using different versions of the nasa-tlx questionnaire on the task load of a study participant.

For this you will first complete a random task from the mini-vlat questionnaire. You will have 25 seconds to answer the question, if you do not answer in time, you can still skip the question. Do not worry if you can not answer the question in time.

Afterwards we will evaluate your subjective task load for _answering the question_. Please answer honestly.

**Then we will evaluate your task load again**. This time we are interested in evaluating your subjective task load in _filling out the NASA-TLX questionnaire_. Please answer honestly again.

## HINT

The NASA-TLX uses six distinct scales to measure your task load. We provide a detailed explanation of the individual scale in the **Help** menu. If you are unclear about the scales at any point, please refer to the Help section.


The entire study will take about 5-10 minutes. Thank you for your time :)
