# Evaluating the task load of the task load index

This is a small study to evaluate the impact of using different versions of the nasa-tlx questionnaire on the task load of a study participant.

For this you will first complete a random task from the mini-vlat questionnaire. **You will have 25 seconds to answer the question**, if you do not answer in time, you can still skip the question. **Do not worry if you can not answer the question in time.**

Afterwards we will evaluate your subjective task load for _answering the question_. Please answer honestly.

**Then we will evaluate your task load again**. This time we are interested in evaluating your subjective task load in _filling out the NASA-TLX questionnaire_. Please answer honestly again.

The entire study will take about 5-10 minutes. Thank you for your time :)

The task will begin imediately after you click "Next".
