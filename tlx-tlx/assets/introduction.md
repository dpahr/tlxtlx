# Evaluating the task load of the task load index

This is a small study to evaluate the impact of using different versions of the nasa-tlx questionnaire on the task load of a study participant.

The study consists of two parts: 

First you will complete a simple visualization task and rate your subjective experience in __completing the task__ using a NASA-TLX questionnaire.

Then you will be presented another NASA-TLX questionnaire. This time we want you to rate your subjective experience in __completing the TLX questionnaire__.

The entire study will take about 5-10 minutes. Thank you for your time :)
